You need https://github.com/devnull-cz/stef to run the tests.

Works on Linux machines at Mal√° Strana labs.  You must test it there before you
submit your solution.  The machines are accessible via SSH, e.g.:

	ssh <your-login>@u-pl3.ms.mff.cuni.cz

The tests work with GNU ed as well so try it out with /bin/ed first to make sure
you get the correct environment.  See stef-config and the STEF documentation for
more information.

Example for the Phase 1 tests:

$ export ED=/bin/ed
$ ~/stef/stef.sh
