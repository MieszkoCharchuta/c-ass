See ./assignment-phase-1.txt.

# Simple ed editor phase 2

# CLI options:

usage: ed [file]

No options supported, use of any options result in message to stderr +
exit(1).  For example:

	ed: illegal option -- l
	usage: ed [file]

# Compilation requirements

Same as for the 1st phase.

# Supported commands

For the "i" command, a single "." ends the input mode.  See ed(1) man
page for details.

For the phase 2, you need to implement the following three commands:

(.)i
(.,.)d

	- see GNU ed man page on how it works

w [file]

	- range is not supported, i.e. the whole file will be always
	  written.  Without the "file" argument, the file will be
	  written to argv[1], and argv[1] will be overwritten if it
	  already exists.  If argv[1] is NULL, the error message is:

	  	No current filename

q	- note that q warns for a modified not written into buffer.  Two
	  consequtive q's quit though and the editor returns 1.
