# Simple ed editor phase 2

# CLI options:

usage: ed [file]

No options supported, use of any options result in message to stderr +
exit(1).  For example:

	ed: illegal option -- l
	usage: ed [file]

# Compilation requirements

Same as for the 1st phase.

# Supported commands

For the "i" command, a single "." ends the input mode.  See ed(1) man
page for details.

For the phase 2, you need to implement the following three commands:

(.)i
(.,.)d

	- see GNU ed man page on how it works

w [file]

	- range is not supported, i.e. the whole file will be always
	  written.  Without the "file" argument, the file will be
	  written to argv[1], and argv[1] will be overwritten if it
	  already exists.  If argv[1] is NULL, the error message is:

	  	No current filename

q	- note that q warns for a modified not written into buffer.  Two
	  consequtive q's quit though and the editor returns 1.

Before you submit your solution, you must pass all the tests for the
Phase 2.  See:
