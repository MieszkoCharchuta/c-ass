# First, we assume you run the tests in a Unix/Linux environment.  If you do not
# have such an environment, either figure it out or log in to a Linux machine at
# the Mala Strana lab.  See http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang/ for more details.

# Before running the tests via "./run-tests.sh", you need to set the "STEF"
# variable in stef-config to the location of "stef.sh".  Get it here:
# https://github.com/devnull-cz/stef
#
# For example:
export STEF="/Volumes/repos/stef/stef.sh"

# Then, you need to set the following two variables to the right values either
# in "test-config.local" or just export them in the same shell before executing
# "./run-tests.sh".  The test suite will build mytar itself using the MYTAR_C
# variable value.
#
# On Linux distros, GNU tar is just /bin/tar.
#
# On macOS, /bin/tar is NOT a GNU tar.  With the MacPorts collection, GNUTAR
# should be set to /opt/local/bin/gnutar.
#
# Example:
export GNUTAR="$(which gnutar)"
export MYTAR_C="/Volumes/repos/mytar/mytar.c"

# In order to verify your testing environment is set up correctly, set MYGNUTAR
# to the system GNU tar.  See the example output below for more information.
export MYGNUTAR="$(which gnutar)"

# Phase 1
./run-tests.sh $(cat phase-1.tests)
# Phase 2
./run-tests.sh

# Example output to verify the testing environment with GNU tar.  You still need
# to set both GNUTAR.  However, you also need to set STEF_REGFILE_LOCAL_VARS to
# a value of " " as otherwise the test would require an existing file in the
# MYTAR_C variable.
