# Source code management

- Keep all of your code somewhere.  Use a *distributed* source code management
  (SCM) system, ie. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or
  [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/).
  - You could even keep your repo in your home directory in the Linux lab as
    some of those machines are accessible via SSH from anywhere or use services
    like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Github](https://github.com) and
    such.
  - We do recommend you never use *centralized* SCMs like
    [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) or
    [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), unless you
    have to (e.g. working on existing legacy software), as those are things of
    the past century.
