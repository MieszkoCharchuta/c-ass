# Source code management

- keep all of your code somewhere.  Use a *distributed* source code management
  (SCM) system, ie. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/).
  - you could keep your repo in your home directory in the Linux lab as
    some of those machines are accessible via SSH from anywhere or use services
    like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Github](https://github.com) and such.
  - never use *centralized* SCMs like Subversion or CVS, unless you really
    have to, as those are things of the past century.
