# Source code management

- keep all of your code somewhere.  Use a distributed source code management
  (SCM) system, ie. Git or Mercurial.
  - you could keep your repo in your home directory in the Linux lab as
    those machines are accessible via SSH from anywhere.
  - never use centralized SCMs like Subversion or CVS, unless you really
    have to, as those are things of the past century.
