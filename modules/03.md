Main topics: ternary operator, arrays, functions

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* warm-up: print out number of words on standard input (you should have the
  getchar() based code in your Github repo already so just copy it and modify).
  A word is defined as group of any chars surrounded by white space
  (for our case these will suffice: tab, space, newline).

  - write your own check for whitespace, do not use library functions for that
  - check with 'wc -w file.txt'
  - what happens if the number of words exceeds the type that stores the count ?

  code: words.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- array intro:

  - definition:  int array[n];

  - always starts from index 0, ends with n - 1

    int array[3] members will be accessible as a[0] .. a[2]
	- the 0 is used there for better work with pointers and efficiency for
	  array access

  - what is not possible in C (limitations are important knowledge):
	- associative arrays
	- array subscripts returning sub-array (like found e.g. in Python)

  - boundless init aka flexible array:

    short array[] = { 1, 2, 3 };

	- there is another place flexible array can be used - at the end of a
	  structure (more on that later)
	- `{ 1, 2, 3 }` is another example of *initializer*, see also the
	  [basics](/modules/basics.md) module

  - arrays defined like this are not dynamic - cannot be resized

	- try to perform out-of-bounds access. What is the threshold for
	  behavior change on your system?  Solution:
	  [array-out-of-bounds.c](/src/array-out-of-bounds.c)

  - not full init:

    short array[4] = { 1, 2, 3 };

	- the value of array[3] will be initialized to 0
	      - If an array is partially initialized, elements that are not
		initialized receive the value 0 of the appropriate type
			- i.e. int array[100] = {0}; will have all values set to
			  0
				  - done by compiler
			- same for global (or static) variables where the memory
			  is zeroed on loading the program into memory

    - corollary: to zeroize the array via initialization:

      int array[16] = { 0 };

      - Note: global variables are always zeroized

    - the array can be initialized with a function

      code: array-init-func.c

  - partial array initialization using a *designated initializer*

    char array[128] = { [0] = 'A', [2] = 'f', [4] = 'o', [6] = 'o' };

    - index is in the square brackets
    - the rest of items will be initialized to zeroes
    - `[index]` is called a designator.  Any designator in an initializer makes
      it a designated initializer

    code: [array-partial-init.c](/src/array-partial-init.c),
    [array-designated-initializers.c](/src/array-designated-initializers.c)

  - once declared, the values cannot be assigned at once

    int array[3];

    array[0] = 1;
    array[1] = 2;
    ...

    or

    static const int _array[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
    memcpy(array, _array, sizeof (array));

  - cannot assign array into array - has to be done item by item
    - likewise for comparison

  - variable length array (VLA)
    - automatically allocated based on a variable

    int n = 5;
    int a[n];

    - :heavy\_exclamation\_mark: it generates more code and much slower code,
      use a constant for small arrays instead.

  - sizeof (array) will get total byte count of array representation
    - how to get number of items in array:

      sizeof (array) / sizeof (array[0])

      - this is good approach that is immune to changing the array declaration
        instead of

      sizeof (array) / sizeof (int)

    - arrays cannot be declared as empty (int a[0])
      - this is forbidden by the standard (ISO 9899:2011 6.7.6.2)

      code: empty-array.c

        - this means the above sizeof() / sizeof(a[0]) construction is always
	  correct. Plus, the compiler does not do any array access when
	  computing sizeof(a[0]), it only uses that to determine the type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* last time you wrote a program to print occurence counts for numbers
  (digits) on standard input. Take the program (ideally from your Github repo)
  and rewrite it to use array.

  solution: count-numbers-array.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- function introduction

  - can be used to encapsulate some work, code re-factoring

  - single return value, multiple input parameters
    - if you need to extract error code or multiple return values
      this needs to be done via passing data via reference
      (more on that when we have pointers)
      - i.e. this is not like Go that returns the error along with the data

  - function declaration:

  int digit(int c);
  int space(int c);

    - default return value is int (but usually compiler will warn if it's
      missing)

    - write the declaration in the beginning of the file or include into
      header file
      - compiler warnings

    - arg names can be omitted

  - K&R definition with types of arguments on separate lines

    int
    foo(a, b)
    int a;
    int b;
    {
      body
    }

  - should be fine to define isdigit()/isspace() w.r.t. definitions in libc
    (because they are usually defined as weak symbols) however if ctype.h
    is included compiler will print warning

  - variable defined in function overrides global variable

  - if the function is declared static, it is visible only from the same
    object file
    - static variables: retain value across function calls

  - local variables are on the stack

  - variable passing depends on bitness and architecture
    - e.g. 32-bit x86 on the stack, 64-bit x64 first 6 regs, then stack

  - functions can be recursive

  - functions can have variable number of arguments of different types
    - ellipsis

    void func(fmt, ...);

    - the first argument describes the rest of arguments in some way
      - usually it is format string. it can be variable count if they are of
        the same type however then they would probably be passed as array
	or pointer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* write a function that takes variable number of ULL arguments
  and returns their sum

  - use the stdarg(3) man page
  - what happens if there is a one 'int' value passed in between the ULL
    arguments ?

code: stdarg.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* print total number of (decimal) numbers, white space (tab, space, newline)
  and anything else from the input.  I.e. it will print out three numbers.

  - write the program using direct comparisons

    c >= '0' && c <= '9'
    c == ' ' || c == '\t' || c == '\n'

  - move both the checks into functions
  - then use:
    - use isspace() from C99
    - isdigit() vs isnumber() - the latter detects digits + possibly more
      characters (depending on locale setting)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arrays and functions:

  - array in C is not first class object, rather it is a composition
    - hence, array cannot be returned from a function
      (however pointer to array can be, more on that later)

    - when array is passed as argument it is converted to a pointer
      to the first item of the array (more on that later)
      - this is done for efficiency as copying the whole array (by value)
        would be too expensive

  - :heavy\_exclamation\_mark: watch for size of an array if used as a local
    variable in a function
    - will increase stack size.  As stack size is generally limited in threaded
      environment, using large arrays may get you in trouble.

    code: func-large-array.c

  - it is possible to use compound literal to pass anonymous array to a
    function.  Using an compound literal may be beneficial when you need an
    object but do not want to declare it.

    code: array-literal.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* count occurrences of all ASCII letters on standard input and print out
  histogram
  - this will be case insensitive (i.e. implement mytolower(int) first)

  the output will look like this:

```
  a: ***
  b: *
  ...
```

  - use function to print the asterisks
  - use function to do all the printing
  - declare the array to be as efficient as possible (i.e. have lowest
    possible size) and to be non-global

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- multi-dimensional arrays: array of arrays

  int a[3][2] = { {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5} };

  - to access a given item all indexes have to be specified in square brackets

    i.e. a[1, 2] does not work, you have to use a[1][2]

  - in memory this is stored as consequent individual "lines"

    - for 3-D array it looks like this:

      int a[][2][3] = {
      			{ {1,2,3}, {4,5,6} },
			{ {8,7,8}, {9,1,9} },
		      };

      - in memory:

      | 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 | 8 7 8 | 9 1 9 |

      code: 3d-array.c

  - the most "significant" dimension of the array can be omitted, but
    nothing below, i.e.

    int [][5];
    int [][3][6];

    are fine. However:

    int [5][6][];
    int [5][][8];

    are not.

    - the reason is that if you do not know how may "lines" are there, it's OK,
      but you always need to know the "length" of the "lines".

code: 2d-array.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* write a program that takes 2-D array of integers and constructs 1-D
  array of maximum values in each sub-array and prints it out to standard
  output.

  - write a function that returns maximum of values in integer array

  code: 2d-array-max.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* home assignment: write a 1-D implementation of Conway's life (rule 30)
  - we now have the arsenal to write 2-D variant however to display 2-D
    world some way to refresh the terminal would be needed so we will stick
    with 1-D.

  http://web.stanford.edu/~cdebs/GameOfLife/#1D

  - each life "tick" will print the line representing the world
  - use functions to refactor the code
  - use two arrays (one 2-D and one 1-D) to represent the rules and its values

  - once having a working solution, try to rewrite it to be more efficient
    or elegant, send the link to your implementation on Github to the mailing
    list

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- ternary operator:

  - intro:

    cond ? expr1 : expr 2

    same as

    if (cond) expr else expr2

    e.g. max = (i > j) ? i : j;

    note that if we add ; it will become a statement, e.g.

      (i == j) ? i++ : j++;

      will increment i or j. the parens are not needed, just for
      readability.

  - you do not need parents around the `i > j` expression as the ternary
    operator has lower priority but in general, parens are used for better
    readability

code: ternary-assign.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* write an expression that returns maximum or 3 integers i,j,k using ternary
  operator

  - do not use any macros

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* rewrite the "convert small characters to upper case" program from last time
  using:
  a) function
  b) function using ternary operator (single line of code)

  code: toupper.c

  - there is a toupper() library function from C99 so use mytoupper()

  - variant: do this via lookup table - array
     - arrays passed as function argument are in reality converted to pointers
       (to be introduced later)
       - so it is useless to write their size like this:

         void func(int array[3]);

       - this is better:

         void func(int array[], size_t size);

       - also, if the items in the array are changed in the function,
         they will be changed in the array itself (consequence of pointer
         conversion)

  - what if conv\_to\_upper(-1) ?
  - short is sufficient to store the value:

    short uppper[] = { 'A', 'B', ... };

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- array of chars (aka *string*)

  char foo[] = { 'b', 'a', 'r', '\0' };

    - string must be terminated by a NUL character (0).  To stress it is taken
      as a character, we use `'\0'`.  See the previous seminar on the `\ooo`
      format, `\0` is just a special case of that.

    - what happens if you forget to specify the terminating zero in the above
      per-char init and try to print the string?

    code: array-char-nozero.c

    - you can also use "bar" for the initializer but more on that later

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* home assignment: write function to convert `uint64_t` to human readable count
  (binary - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders\_of\_magnitude\_(data) or
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte, e.g. MiB as mebibyte, etc.)
  and print it to standard output

```C
	void bytecnt2str(uint64_t num);
```

  - use character array to represent the magnitude letters and perform
    the lookup based on the actual magnitude
  - if there is a remainder, write a '+' following the number
  - write the output in single printf() (use ternary operator for the remainder)

  - example inputs/outputs:

1024		1 KiB
1025		1+ KiB
2047		1+ KiB
2048		2 KiB
2049		2+ KiB
5242880		5 MiB

  code: bytecnt2str.c
