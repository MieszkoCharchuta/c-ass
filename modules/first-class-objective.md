# Objective of the first class

- The objective of today's class is to provide all the basic building blocks so
  that you can write code for moving a star (`*`) in a loop from left to right,
  and back, on a terminal line, as a home assignment.
- To see what we mean, compile it via `cc src/moving-star.c` (clone the git repo
  first, see
#module intro.md Introduction
  for more info) and run it via `./a.out`.
- Obviously, do not look at our code until you have written your own.
- Now, let's move on!
