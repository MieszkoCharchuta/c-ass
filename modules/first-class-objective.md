# Objective of the first class

- The objective of today's class is to provide all the building blocks so that
  you can write code for moving a star in a loop from left to right, and back,
  as a home assignment
- to see what we mean, compile `moving-star.c`, and run it via `./a.out`.
- now, let's move on!
