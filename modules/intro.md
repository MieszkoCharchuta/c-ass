# Introduction

- all information on http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang
	- see the References section for recommended materials
- make sure you DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAILING LIST (see the seminar http page
  above)
- getting credits - see the seminar web page above
- what is C
- C89, C99, C11 (ie. 2011), C17 (only fixes issues found in C11) standards.  Due
  to time constraints, we will focus on C99.
- why it's worth to learn C
	- helps with better understanding of computers
	- lingua franca of programming
	- lots of important code in C (Linux and Android kernel, Apple iOS
	  kernel (Darwin), major parts of Windows kernel, OpenSSH, OpenSSL,
	  Apache, NGINX, cURL, etc. etc.)
	- C programmers will be needed virtually for ever
	- fast, very portable
		- however, now at the expense of having very complex compilers
		  (see e.g. https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479)
	- battle proven
	- great cost/benefit ratio wrt spent time learning the language
	- still cool and fun
- objectives of the seminar
	- you should be able to write and understand non-trivial C code (we
	  focus on C99)
	- you should be able to recognise whether C is appropriate for solving a
	  specific problem
	- why it's so easy to get burned when working in C
		- [A Case Study of Toyota Unintended Acceleration and Software
		  Safety](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/pubs/koopman14_toyota_ua_slides.pdf)
- we are here to help you understand concepts, see the big picture, and learn
  new stuff.  SO, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION, ASK.
	- Ideally use the mailing list so that it's beneficial for others, too.
- please do read the C style document and DO USE the C style.  The link is on
  the seminar page, or you can get it here: http://mff.devnull.cz/cstyle/.
- source code files are in https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/tree/master/src
