# Static variables and functions

If a function is declared `static`, it is visible only from the same source code
file.

Static variables: they retain value across function calls.  That is, the
initialization of a static variable within a function is done only once.

Yes, the word `static` is overloaded in C.

:wrench: Take the binary tree implementation and use the `static` keyword where
it makes sense.
