# :wrench: Warm-up: bit difference

Task: write a program that counts the number of bits that need to be flipped so
      that number A becomes number B.

Note: use the character representation only for debug prints. The actual
      operations with the numbers are to be done with bit operations on
      integers.

Note: consider only positive integers
