# :wrench: Warm-up: bit difference

Task: write a program that counts the number of bits that need to be flipped so
      that number A becomes number B.

Note: use the character representation only for debug prints. The actual
      operations with the numbers are to be done with bit operations on
      integers.

Note: consider only positive integers, assume `int`.

#source bitdiff.c
#source binprint.c

Sub-task for home: flip those bits and verify that the numbers are the same.
