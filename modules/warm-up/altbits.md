## :wrench: alternating bits detection

Task: detect if binary representation of an `int` has alternating bits,
e.g. `01010101`.

Start with naive/straightforward implementation, i.e. traverse all the bits
(O(n) time) and use bit operations/arithmetics.

Note: this can be done in O(1) time using some tricks
