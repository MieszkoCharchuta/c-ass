# 10 minute warm-up

./a.out dragon firefly jupiter

- Using the pointer arithmetics and the dereference operator `*` only , given
  the exact command line above, print 'g' from the first argument, 'r' from the
  2nd, and 't' from the last one.
- That is, you must not use brackets `[]` at all.
- You can assume the command will have the arguments above, i.e. it's OK to
  crash if you run it without any arguments, for example.
- It is still good to verify you have at least 3 arguments.
- Remember #module program-arguments.md
