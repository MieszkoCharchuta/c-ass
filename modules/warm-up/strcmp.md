:task: #warm-up: implement strcmp()

Implement

    int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

returns (according to the strcmp(3) manual page)
> an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according as the
> string s1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the string s2.

#source strcmp.c

:wrench: task: compare your solution with the above. Try to reimplement
it so that it is as smallest (in terms of Lines Of Code) as possible.
