# :wrench: warm-up: implement strcmp()

Implement

```C
    int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);
```

returns (according to the strcmp(3) manual page)
> an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0, according as the
> string s1 is greater than, equal to, or less than the string s2.

#solution strcmp.c

:wrench: compare your solution with the above. Try to reimplement
it so that it is as smallest (in terms of Lines Of Code) as possible.
