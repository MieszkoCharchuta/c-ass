## :wrench: Warm-up: Number of bits for binary representation

Given an `int` (assume 4 bytes) with a positive value, use bit operators to find
out how many bits (and bytes) will be needed to represent the number in binary.
Then rewrite
#source print-in-binary.c
using the acquired number.

Note: be careful about little vs big endian
