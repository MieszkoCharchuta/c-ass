# :wrench: Warm-up: Number of bits for binary representation

Given an `int` (assume 4 bytes) with positive value, find out (using bit
operators) how many bits (characters) will be needed to represent the number in
binary. Then rewrite
#source binprint.c
using the acquired number.

Note: little vs big endian
