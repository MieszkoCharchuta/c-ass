## :wrench: Count digit occurrence

If unsure about the behavior, compile our solution and run it.

- read characters until EOF. count occurence of each 0-9 digit.
  Only use what we have learned so far.
  You end up with longer code than otherwise necessary but that is OK.

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | ./a.out
0: 27
1: 37
2: 152
3: 38
4: 39
5: 43
6: 34
7: 35
8: 29
9: 31
```

Solution: #source count-numbers.c
