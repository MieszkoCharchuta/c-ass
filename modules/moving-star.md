# assignment for the first class

```
  /*
   * Implement a moving star that zick zacks on the __SAME__ line between some
   * boundary (say 50 character wide).
   *
   * You will only need:
   *	- while loop
   *	- printf()
   *	- use a character '\r' to return to the beginning of a line
   *	- use "poll(NULL, 0, <ms>)" to sleep <ms> miliseconds, do not worry
   *	  about not understanding what exactly it does
   *    - you will also need "fflush(stdout)" after each line is printed.  As
   *      standard error is buffered, the text will generally not be printed by
   *      printf() until a new line is printed, which will never be the case
   *      here.  So, "fflush" makes sure all buffered text is printed out.
