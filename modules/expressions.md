# Expressions

- any expression has a value

- logical expression has value 0 or 1, and it's type is always "int"
```
	1 > 10	... 0
	10 > 1	... 1

	printf("%d\n", 1 < 10);
	--> 1
	/* Yes, "equal to" in C is "==" as "=" is used for an assignment */
	printf("%d\n", 100 == 101);
	--> 0
```
- neverending while loop is then:
```
	while (1) {
		...
	}
```
