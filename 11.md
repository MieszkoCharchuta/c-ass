# Recap

XXX

# Warm-up

Define a structure with 2 items: `char *` and pointer to the next item.
Write a function that will create a simple linked list of command line
arguments using dynamic allocation, a function that will print out the
whole list, and one that will properly free the list.

Function prototypes:
```C
   struct item *create_list(char **argv); // returns new head of the list
   void print_list(struct *item head);
   void destroy_list(struct *item head);
```
Note: you can reuse the linked list source from the last lecture

Bonus: run the program with Valgrind to see if there any memory leaks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The last initializer and a comma
```C
struct s {
	int a;
	int b;
} s = { 1, 2, };	// ',' after 2 is optional
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enumeration constant

We already know integer constants, character and string constants, a
floating-point constant, constant expression (an expression that
involves only constants).

There is one other kind of constant, the "enumeration constant".  An
enumeration is a list of constant integer values, as in:
```C
enum boolean { NO, YES};
```
The first name has value 0, the next one 1, etc.  You can use explicit
values as well.  Unspecified values continue to progress from the last
value specified.  For example:
```C
enum months { JAN = 1,
	      FEB,
	      MAR,
	      APR,
	      MAY,
	      JUN,
	      JUL,
	      AUG,
	      SEP,
	      OCT,
	      NOV,
	      DEC,
};
```
The list consists of "enumerators".  I.e. both "JAN = 1" and "FEB" are
enumerators.  "JAN", "FEB", "MAR" etc. are "enumeration constants".  The
values of enumeration constants must fit an int.  However, the
implementation may define any integer type to be compatible with the
enumerated type under the condition that all enumeration contants fit
the type.  So, the implemenetation **might** choose a char to be
compatible with the enum boolean above.
```C
enum white_space { NL = '\n', SP = ' ', TAB = '\t' };
```
Names in different enumerations must be distinct.  In other words, all
enumerators share the same name space.  Values in the same enumerations
need not be distinct, e.g.:
```C
enum not_really_useful { GGG = 1, HHH = 1, GHGH = 0 };
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The `const` keyword

"const" is a "qualifier" that may be applied to the declaration of any
variable.  It specifies its value cannot be changed.  If you apply const to an
array, the array elements cannot be modified.

You can initialize the variable declared with the const qualifier.

Example: :eyes: [const.c](src/const.c)

Using `const` will not really make a variable constant, you just cannot
use that variable for an assignment.
```C
int i = 'c';
int const *i2 = &i;

// illegal
*i2 = 'x';
// ok
i = 'x';
```
Example: :eyes: [const-not-really-a-const.c](src/const-not-really-a-const.c)

It also depends where you apply the `const` keyword.
```C
char const *s1;		// s is a pointer to const char
const char *s1;		// same as above
char *const s2;		// s is a const pointer to a char

*s1 = 'c';		// illegal
s1 = NULL;		// legal

s2 = NULL;		// illegal
*s2 = 'a';		// legal
```
Example: :eyes: [const-and-pointers.c](src/const-and-pointers.c)

Using `const` can get a bit confusing.  It is mostly used for pointer
arguments to const memory to specify an array will not be changed in
the function.  For example, string functions:
```C
size_t strlen(const char *s);
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
...
```
The following is a const pointer to a const character.  So, you can
neither do `*p = ...` nor `p = ...`.  Verify.
```C
const char *const p;
```

# The `typedef` keyword

- note that char, the signed and unsigned integer types, and the
  floating types are collectively called "basic types".
- then you have "derived types" - an array type, a structure, a union, a
  function type, a pointer type.

With "typedef", you create new data type **names** for existing types.
Note that you do NOT create new data **types** with typedef.  With
typedef, you create synonymums to existing types.

Typedef is most commonly used for derived types but many C provided
names are based on basic types.  For example, `size_t`, see its definition
in /usr/include/sys/types.h.

Typedef is used like this:
```C
typedef int myint;
typedef *char mycharptr;

mycharptr *p = "my string";
```
Typedef is also great to create complex type names in small steps.  As
we will see next.
```C
typedef char **array[10];
array a;
```
Example: :eyes: [derived-types.c](src/derived-types.c)

The convention is to add `_t` to a new type name.  For example:
```C
typedef struct mystruct_s {
	int a;
	char c;
} mystruct_t;
```
And you can use it like this:
```C
struct mystruct_s x;
mystruct_t y;
```
'x' and 'y' are of the same type.

Example: :eyes: [typedef.c](src/typedef.c)

Assignment: use `typedef` in the warm-up code for the item structure and
use the new name instead of `struct item ...`.

# Variable name space & scope

Identifiers fall into several name spaces that do not interfere with one
another.

These classes are: objects, functions, typedef constants; labels; tags of
structures or unions, and enumerations; and structure or union individually.

The "individual" part means each structure or union has its own namespace.

Example: :eyes: [identifier-name-space.c](src/identifier-name-space.c)

# Reading complex declarations
```C
char **argv
````
   argv is a pointer to a pointer to char
```C
int (*a)[10]
```
   a is a pointer to an array of 10 ints
```C
int *a[10]
```
   a is an array of 10 pointers to int
```C
void *myfunc()
```
   myfunc is a function returning a pointer to void
```C
void (*myfunc)()
```
   myfunc is a pointer to a function returning void
```C
char (*(*x())[])()
```
   x is a function returning pointer to an array of pointers to a
   function returning a char
```C
char (*(*x[3])())[5]
```
   x is an array[3] of pointers to a function returning
   a pointer to an array[5] of chars

## How to read it

  1. find identifier (non keyword or custom type) of variable or function
  2. start decoding:
     - L to R
       - `)`  => reverse decoding direction
       - `()` => denotes function
       - `[]` => array
       - `;`  => reverse the direction
     - when reading from R to L, we can hit:
       - `(`   => reverse the direction
       - `*`   => pointer
       - type identifier => starts the whole definition


Example: 
```C
char *(*(**foo[][8])())[];
```

You can mentally simplify as: 
```C
char *(*SOME_FUNCTION)[];
```
Where `SOME_FUNCTION` is `(**foo[][8])()`

Read as:

foo is an array of arrays of 8 pointers to a pointer to a function
returning a pointer to an array of pointers to a char.

Alternatively, you can do it via two simpler steps:
```C
typedef char *a_of_p[];
typedef a_of_p *(**foo[][8])();
```
Example: :eyes: [complex-declaration.c](src/complex-declaration.c)

:wrench: Practice:
```C
int *(*(*fp1)(int))[10];
char (*(*x())[])()
double *f()[]		// this is not legal in C as a function cannot
			// return an array
```

# Bitwise operations

:wrench: Assignment:

Print `argv[1]` in binary.  Note that printf(3) does not have a conversion
specifier for it (unlike 'x' for hexa and 'o' for octal).  Limit the
input to positive ints.  Do not use bit operators even if you know how
to (ie. do NOT use >> etc.)

To verify, use bc(1) with obase=2.  E.g.:
```
$ bc
obase=2
10
1010
255
11111111
2^31-1
1111111111111111111111111111111

$ ./a.out 2147483647
1111111111111111111111111111111
$ ./a.out 255
11111111
$ ./a.out 348508345
10100110001011101000010111001
```
You can also use `obase=8`, `obase=16`, etc.  Note that bc(1) takes only
capital letters as digits, ie. use "E4" for 0xe4, not "e4".  "e4" is
treated as a variable:
```
$ bc
ibase=16
obase=2
e4
0
E4
11100100
```
Solution: :eyes: [print-in-binary.c](src/print-in-binary.c)

Bitwise operators are as follows:

Operator | Meaning
--- | ---
`&`	| bitwise AND
`\|`	| bitwise OR
`^`	| bitwise XOR
`<<`	| left shift
`>>`	| right shift
`~`	| one's complement (unary)

Note, individual bits are being processed.  I.e.:
```
316 & 978			-> convert to binary to see it
100111100 & 1111010010		-> do logical AND bit by bit now

0100111100
1111010010
----------
0100010000	== 272 (use ibase=2 with bc(1) to verify)
```
So, 
```
((338 & 978) == 272).	// == is of higher prority than &
```
Common uses of bitwise operators:
```C
	n = n & 01777;			// zero out some lowest bits

	/*
	 * Setting individual flags.  Note that each of the flags has
	 * just one bit set.
	 */
	#define	LIGHT_OFF	0x0000
	#define	LIGHT_GREEN	0x0001
	#define	LIGHT_RED	0x0002
	#define	LIGHT_BLUE	0x0004
	#define	LIGHT_YELLOW	0x0008
	#define	LIGHT_VIOLET	0x0010
	#define	LIGHT_WHITE	0x0020
	...

	lights = lights | LIGHT_YELLOW;	// turn on yellow light
	lights = lights & ~LIGHT_RED;	// turn off red light
```
When working with bitwise operators, operands are promoted the same way
as we learned in lecture 05 (see "Various conversions and promotions").
That means:
```
13U & -1				-> promote int (-1) to unsigned,
					   i.e.  promote -1 to unsigned.
					   You get:

13 & 4294967295				-> now convert to binary
1101 & 11111111111111111111111111111111	-> the result clearly is 1101
```

[conv-and-prom-with-bitwise-ops.c](src/conv-and-prom-with-bitwise-ops.c)

:wrench: Assignment: rewrite print-in-binary.c using bitwise operators

:wrench: Assignment: count 1 bits in a number (argv[1]).

	$ ./a.out 337
	4
	$ ./a.out 13375
	9

:wrench: Assignment:

Consider the function `getbits(x,p,n)` that returns the (right adjusted)
n-bit field of x that begins at position p.  We assume that bit position
0 is at the right end and that n and p are sensible positive values.
For example, `getbits(x,4,3)` returns the three bits in positions 4, 3 and
2, right-adjusted.

The idea is to zero out anything that is to the left of 'p', then shift those
'n' bits to the very right, and you get the result.

	/* 1 0000 0000: should return 1 */
        i = getbits(0x100, 8, 1);
        (void) printf("0x%X\n", i);
        assert(i == 1);

	/* 1110 0100: should return 9 */
        i = getbits(0xe4, 5, 4);
        (void) printf("0x%X\n", i);
        assert(i == 9);

	/* 1010 1010: should return the same number, ie. 0xAA */
        i = getbits(0xAA, 7, 8);
        (void) printf("0x%X\n", i);
        assert(i == 0xAA);

(Note: this assignment was actually given the last year as the
assignment for the final class with the 90 minute limit).
```C
