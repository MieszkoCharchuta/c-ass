# Recap of the last class

Comments, preprocessor, expressions, `break`, operators, `_Bool`, integer types,
signedness, modifiers for `printf`(), L/U suffices, `sizeof` operator, integer
literals, `getchar`().

# Warm-up

#include "modules/count-words.md"

#include "modules/array-intro.md"

#include "modules/home-assignment-section.md"

Do [digit occurence](/modules/count-digit-occurence.md) as in the last class but
now use an array for counting the figures.

#include "modules/function-intro.md"

#include "modules/home-assignment-section.md"

:wrench: Print total number of (decimal) numbers, white space (tab, space,
newline) and anything else from the input.  I.e. it will print out three
numbers.

Obviously, reuse code you wrote for [digit occurence
counting](/src/count-digit-occurence.md).

- write the program using direct comparisons

```C
c >= '0' && c <= '9'
c == ' ' || c == '\t' || c == '\n'
```

- move both the checks into functions
- then write a new version and use:
	- use isspace() from C99
	- isdigit() vs isnumber() - the latter detects digits + possibly more
	  characters (depending on locale setting)
