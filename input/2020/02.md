# recap of the first class

- make sure you DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAILING LIST (see http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang
  on how to do that).  If you miss some information posted to the mailing
  list because you are not subscribed, it is your problem :-)

- assignment from the previous class: moving star on the console
	- our solution (we strongly recommend you code it first by yourself) is
	  in [moving-star.c](/src/moving-star.c)
