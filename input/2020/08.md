# Recap

- pointer is just a variable, stores an address of another object
- to get the value, use dereference operator
- sizeof() applied to pointer will get the size of its storage
- ptrs are handy for passing by reference
- NULL by definition unmapped
- array "name" is pointer to the 1st elem
  - not a variable => cannot be modified
- subscripting arrays vs. pointer arith `a[i] = *(a + i)`
- using the pointer variable is using its value, i.e. the address
- ptr dec/increment advances by the size of the underlying type
- addr operator `&` can only be used on variables
- pointers can be subtracted, not added (no sense)
- `void` pointer can be used to assign back and forth
- postfix has higher precedence than deref op however will be evaluated in the
  next sequence
- `errno` variable (of type `int`) signifies the last error of a syscall
  - on Unix see the `errno(3)` man page for possible error codes
  - handy `err()` family of functions (non in the C standard though)
- I/O ops done with file handle
  - fopen/fgets/fclose
  - watch out for resource leaks: [fopen-leak.c](src/fopen-leak.c)
