# Recap

- pointer is just a variable, stores an address of another object
- NULL by definition unmapped (modulo stuff like the `0@0.so` library on
  Solaris - for the curious see the `ld.so.1` manual page there)
- to get the value of the underlying data, use the dereference operator (`*`)
- sizeof() applied to a pointer will get the size of its storage
  - sizeof() applied on a dereferenced pointer will get the size of the
    underlying data object
- array "name" is a pointer to its 1st elem
  - the name itself is not a modifiable expression
- subscripting arrays vs. pointer arith `a[i] = *(a + i)`
- using the pointer variable is using its value, i.e. the address
- pointer decrement/increment advances by the size of the underlying type
- addr operator `&` can be used on variables
- pointers can be subtracted, not added (no sense)
- `void` pointer can be used to assign back and forth
- an array passed as an argument to a function is converted to a pointer to its
  first element
- function arguments are always passed by value
  - corollary: to change an argument of a function, it is necessary to use a
    pointer
