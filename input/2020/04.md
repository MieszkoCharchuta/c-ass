# Recap of the last class

# Warm-up

TBD: strlen() moved from 03 to here
#include "modules/string-length.md"

Also I did not do multidimensional arrays from
http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang/2019/03--Mar-05/03.txt in 03 but I do suggest
to put them to a later class and not to 04.

The -Wextra -Wall options should go here to this class as we have not mentioned
those yet.

	- function use without prototypes
	- functions not returning a value
	- etc.
