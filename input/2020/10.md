# Recap

- pointer to pointer is useful when we need to change the address
  of where the pointer points to (in a function)
- pointer to pointer is not the same as pointer to array of pointers
  - esp. in a function
- explicit casting
  - sometimes needed even for integer types (e.g. in `printf` arguments)
  - handy for pointers to structures
  - when casting pointers beware of alignment issues
- heap allocation
  - always check return values of functions that allocate memory!
  - risk of memory leaks: use static/dynamic checkers
- no need to cast when working with `void *`
