# Introduction

- all information on http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang
	- see the References section for materials
- make sure you DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAILING LIST (see the seminar http page
  above)
- getting credits - see the seminar page
- what is C
- C89, C99, C11 (ie. 2011) standards.  We will focus on C99.
- why it's worth to learn C
	- helps with deeper understanding of computers
	- lingua franca of programming
	- lots of important code in C (Linux, Android kernel, parts of iOS
	  kernel, parts of Windows kernel, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, Apache, etc. etc.)
	- C programmers will be needed virtually for ever
	- fast, very portable
	- cool and fun
- objectives of the seminar
	- you should be able to write and understand non-trivial C code (we
	  focus on C99)
	- you should be able to recognise whether C is appropriate for solving a
	  specific problem
	- why it's so easy to get burned when working in C
- we are here to help you understand concepts, see the big picture, and learn
  new stuff.  SO, IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION, ASK.
	- Ideally use the mailing list so that it's beneficial for others, too.
- please do read the C style document and DO USE the C style.  The link is on
  the seminar page, or you can get it here: http://mff.devnull.cz/cstyle/.
- source code files are in https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/tree/master/src

# First steps

## first C program: "Hello, world"

- :eyes: [hello-world1.c](src/hello-world1.c), will compile with warnings
- use `gcc hello-world1.c` to compile it, `./a.out` to run it
	- or `gcc -o hello-world1 hello-world1.c` if you want a specific output
- we recommend vim(1) to edit your files (use ":syntax on" for syntax
	  highlighting if not the default settings)
		- see http://mff.devnull.cz/vim-tips.html
- C system runtime very small, printf is not part of it, that's why you
	  need an include file to provide the function prototype (ie. the return
	  type and its parameters)
- fixed code with no warnings: hello-world2.c

see [basics](#Basics)

## Basics

- each program must have a `main()` function
- string literals
	- :eyes: [printf.c](src/printf.c)
- use the `return` operator to return a function value
	- in the `main()` funtion, return exits the program
	- in the shell, use `echo $?` to see the return value of the most
	  recently run program on the foreground
	- only the least significant byte taken as an unsigned integer (0-255)
	  is relevant
	- return.c
	- if you do not use return from main() and the ending } is reached, the
	  program returns 0 (in C99, in C89 it would be a random number).
- you must declare a variable before you can use it
	- :eyes: [declaration.c](src/declaration.c)
- printf() can use conversion specifications
	- `int i; printf("%d\n", i);`
	- see `man 3 printf` for the gory details
	- number of conversions must match the number of arguments
		- :eyes: [printf2.c](src/printf2.c)
		- the compiler will warn you but it will let you do it (use
		  `-Werror` to treat warnings as errors)
		- it will print garbage for conversions without a matching
		  argument (whatever is on the stack).
- arithmetics
	- +, -, /, *
	- ++, --
		- `int i = 13; printf("%d\n", i++);` will print 13 and then
		  increment i
		- `int i = 13; printf("%d\n", ++i);` will first increment i and
		  print 14
		- `++i` is an expression, not a variable, so you cannot assign to it
			- will not compile: `++i = 13;`
	- :eyes: [arithmetics.c](src/arithmetics.c)
- anywhere you can use a variable, you can use an expression
	```C
	printf("%d\n", 100 * 2);
	```
- if both operands are ints, the result is an int
	`printf("%d\n", 9 / 5)` will print 1
- while loop
	- :eyes: [while.c](src/while.c)
- floating point numbers
	- :eyes: [float.c](src/float.c)
	- see the optional minimum field width and precision
	- experiment !!!
- print out a table for inch to centimeter conversion
	- :eyes: [inches-to-cm.c](src/inches-to-cm.c)
	- use "\t" escape sequence for printf to print tabelators
	- like this:
	   ```C
	   printf("\tX\tY\n");
	   ```
- :wrench: use floats for the conversion code
	- [inches-to-cm2.c](src/inches-to-cm2.c)
- :wrench: print fahrenheit to centigrade table.  Use floats.
	- [fahr-to-cent.c](src/fahr-to-cent.c)
