# Recap

- string literal is expression whose value is the address of the 1st element of the array
- pointer to string literal can be changed, however the value of the string is read-only
- the address of char array initialized with string cannot be changed, the contents can be
- explicit casting works however beware alignment issues
- no need to cast when working with `void *`
- there are 2 storage classes - automatic and static, variable can be either `auto` (this is a keyword !) or `static`
- storage expresses lifetime, static variables can be initialized just once
- global variables are always static

# Structures

## Basics

  - collection of one or more variables, possibly of different types, grouped
    together under a single name

  - structures permit group of related variables to be treated as a unit
    (precursor to a class in Object Oriented Programming)

  - structures can contain other structures

  - structure is specified as:
```C
    struct foo {
       ... // members
    };
```
   e.g.
```C
    struct foo {
    	int a;
    	char b;
    };
```
  - any type can be a member of a structure except the structure itself

	- however: pointer to its own type is possible (remember, a
	  pointer is just a number referencing a piece of memory)

  - struct declaration cannot contain initializers.  However, the
    structure can be initialized with a list of initializers in the same
    way as arrays.

  - define a variable:
```C
    struct foo foo;
```
   - usually the `_s` postfix is used to denote a structure name

   Note: the `struct` keyword has to be used for its definition and
   declaration:

  `foo foo;` is not valid.

  - can declare structure and its variables at the same time:
```C
    struct foo_s {
       ...
    } foo;
```
- however usually this is not done because structures are
	  normally saved to header files (and including such a header
	  file would mean a variable definition which is usually not
	  desirable)

  - for better code readability, members are sometimes prefixed with a
    letter to denote their structure type, e.g.:
```C
    // 'sin' is a shortcut for 'Sockaddr_IN', the Internet socket
    // address
    struct sockaddr_in {
	short   sin_family;
        u_short sin_port;
    };
```
   - another reason is when looking for variable names in a big
	  source code repository (using tags or cstyle), there would be
	  large amount of generally named variables like "port", "size",
	  etc in various source code files.  However, with the prefix,
	  like "sin_port", very often you find just one, the one you are
	  looking for.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Struct layout in memory
```C
struct X { int a; char b; int c; };
```
 - the offset of the first member will be always 0
 - other members can be padded to preserve self-alignment
 (i.e. member is always aligned in memory to multiple of its own size)
   - the value of the padding bits is undefined

 - what will be the result of `sizeof (struct X)` ?
   - why ? (think about efficiency of accessing members that cross a word in
     memory)
 - what if `char d` is added at the end of the data structure ?
   - why is that ? (think about arrays and memory access again)
 - what if `char *d` is added at the end of the data structure ?
   (i.e. it will have 4 members)
   - assume this is being compiled on 64-bit machine
     - for efficiency the access to the pointer should be aligned to its size
     - if in doubt, draw a picture
```
	+-----------+----+--------+------------+
	|     a     | b  |   pad  |      c     |
	+-----------+----+--------+------------+
```

 - does the compiler reorder struct members ? no, C is designed to trust
   the programmer.

:eyes: code: [struct-X.c](src/struct-X.c)

note: gcc/Clang has the `-fpack-struct` option that will condense the members
      at the expense of speed when accessing them.  Use only when you
      know what you are doing as it may not be safe on all architectures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Struct members

  - members are accessed via 2 operators: `.` and `->`
	- infix, in the group of operators with the highest precedence
	- `->` is used if the variable is a pointer, `.` otherwise

  - e.g.:
```C
  struct foo_s {
	int a;
	char b;
  } foo;

  foo.a = 42;
  foo.b = 'C';
```
  - the `.` and `->` operators have higher precedence than `*` and `&`, so:

    `&foo.b` gets the address of the member `b`

:eyes: code: [struct-reference.c](src/struct-reference.c)

  - structure assignment
```C
    struct foo_s one, two;

    one = two;
```
   - is done byte by byte (shallow copy - does not follow pointers)
     - handy for members that are pointers
     - on the other hand for large structures (say hundreds of bytes)
       this can be quite an expensive operation

  - pointers to structures:
```C
    struct foo_s *foo;

    foo->a = 42;
    foo->b = 'C';
```
Task: write the above assignments using a de-reference operator on 'foo'

:eyes: code: [struct-access.c](src/struct-access.c)

:wrench: now if `a` was a pointer to integer, how would the code change ?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Struct initialization

  - can initialize in definition using the initiator list of **constant**
    values
```C
    struct foo_s {
       int a;
       char b;
    };

    struct foo_s foo = { 1, 'C' };
```
:eyes: code: [struct-init.c](src/struct-init.c)

  - or using 'designated initializers' from C99:
```C
    struct foo_s foo = {
            .b = 'C',
            .a = 1
    };
```
  - the ordering in the struct declaration does not have to be preserved

  - omitted field members are implicitly initialized the same as objects
    that have static storage duration (ie. will be initialized to 0).

:eyes: code: [struct-designated-init.c](src/struct-designated-init.c)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Operations on structures

You can only:
  - copy a structure
  - assign to it as a unit
  - taking its address with &
  - access its members

So, structures cannot be:
  - compared
  - incremented (obviously)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: Task: define array of structures of this type:
```C
        struct animal {
           char name[NAME_MAX]; // max filename length should be sufficient
				// even for these long Latin names
           size_t legs;		// can have many legs
        };
```
   and initialize it with some samples (can store the array in animals.h)
   and implement a function:
```C
      size_t count_minlegs(struct animal *, size_t len, size_t min);
```
   that will return number of animals in the array (of 'len' items)
   that have at least 'min' legs.

   Notice that the function returns `size_t`. This way it is ready for future
   expansion. If it returned unsigned int and 32-bits was not found enough
   later on, the prototype would have to be changed which would cause
   problems for the consumers of this API.

   The function will be implemented in a separate file.
   (Do not forget to create a header file(s).)

   In the main() program pass (first arg will specify the 'min' parameter of
   the functoin) the array of struct to the function and report result.

Note: will need:
  - `limits.h` for the `NAME_MAX` definition
  - `stddef.h` for `size_t` (as per C99, ยง7.17)

:eyes: code: [struct-animals.c](src/struct-animals.c),
[animal\_minlegs.c](src/animal\_minlegs.c), [animal.h](src/animal.h),
[animals.h](src/animals.h)

Note: for compilation it is only necessary to compile the `*.c` files
      and then link them together.

   It can be done e.g. like this:

      cc struct-animals.c animal_minlegs.c

   where the compiler will do the compilation of the individual object
   files and then call the linker to contruct the binary (named 'a.out').

   Or like this:

      cc -c struct-animals.c animal_minlegs.c
      cc -o animals struct-animals.o animal_minlegs.o

   which is closer to what would be done using Makfile.

   Technically, `animals.h` contains code, however, given it is included
   in a `.c` file it is not necessary to compile it individually.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: Task: use the code from previous task and implement (in separate .c file)

      static size_t getlegs(struct animal *);

   that will return number of legs for a given animal.

   Then implement:

      struct animal *maxlegs(struct animal *, size_t len);

   that will use the getlegs() function and will return an animal
   with highest leg count. Return pointer to the structure (= array
   element) from the function.

   The main() function (in separate file) will define an array of animals
   and will call maxlegs().  The name of the animal with maximum
   number of legs will be printed to standard output.

Note: does the original structure change if the structure returned from the
      function was modified within the function? How to fix this?

:eyes: code: [animal\_maxlegs.c](src/animal\_maxlegs.c), [maxlegs.c](src/maxlegs.c),
[animals.h](src/animals.h), [animal.h](src/animal.h)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: (home) Task: sort the array by number of legs, print it out to standard output.

:wrench: Task: sort the array by the animal name. Print it out to standard output.
      Use strcmp() to do the comparison of names.

:wrench: Task: add a function that will sort according to the number of legs

Make the comparison functions static.

Use the standard libc sort function qsort(3).  Check the manual page on
how it's used.  You will need to define a callback function that the
qsort() function will use to compare two array elements.

Make the program to accept an argument (0 or 1) and run the sorting function
based on that.

:eyes: code: [animal-sort.c](src/animal-sort.c), [animals.h](src/animals.h), [animal.h](src/animal.h)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Pointer to structure and type casting

- pointers to structures are often used to achieve common interface
  for different types
  - e.g.
```C
    struct Common { int type; };
    struct A      { int type; char data[8]; };	// type == 1
    struct B      { int type; char data[16]; }; // type == 2
```
  - then a function can be declared like so:
```C
    int func(struct Common *c);
```
  - internally it can do e.g.:
```C
    if (c->type == 1) {
    	struct A *ap = (struct A *)c;
	ap->data[7] = 'A';
    } else if (c->type == 2) {
    	struct B *bp = (struct B *)c;
	ap->data[15] = 'B';
    }
```
  - this is possible since all the structures have the same member
    on the same offset (that is offset 0)

:eyes: code: [struct-common.c](src/struct-common.c)

Or, more commonly, a function will allocate a A or B structure and return its
address as pointer to the Common struct. This pointer then needs to be casted
according to its first member.

See `struct sockaddr`, `struct sockaddr_in` and `struct sockaddr_in6`
definitions for example on how this is done in practice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: task: write a macro (or start with a function with hardcoded values) that will
      print the offset of the specified member of a given structure.

      offsetof(struct X, a)

hint: exploit the fact that pointer can be assigned an integer (0)
      + use pointer arithmetics

note: `offsetof()` is standard macro available since ANSI C via stddef.h

:eyes: code: [offsetof.c](src/offsetof.c)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## bit fields

- sometimes memory in struct is scarce (imagine having to keep thousands of big
  structures in memory) and there are members holding integers than occupy just
  a couple of bytes
  - bit fields can be used to shrink the memory needed
```C
struct foo {
	unsigned int a : 3;
	unsigned int b : 1;
	unsigned int   : 4;
};
```
 - the number after the colon specifies the number of bits for given bit field
   - cannot exceed the size of the underlying data type (`unsigned int` in the
     above example)

 - this is good for implementing network protocol headers or HW registers,
   however the layout of bit fields in C structure is implementation dependent
   - if it needs to match a concrete layout, additional non-standard compiler
     features have to be used (`#pragma`'s etc.)
   - there is no `offsetof()` for bit fields

:eyes: code: [bitfield.c](src/bitfield.c)

- the integer values will behave as expected, e.g.
```C
  unsigned int a : 3;

  a = 7;
  a++; // will wraparound to 0 since this is unsigned
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: task: declare a structure that will form a simple linked list and will hold
      an integer as a value. The program will be run with a single argument
      specifying how many items the list will have.

   Allocate a new structure and insert into the head (global variable).
   Each new item will have its value incremented by one.

   Once the list is complete, print its value by traversing its items from
   head to end.

:eyes: code: [linked-list-free.c](src/linked-list-free.c)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## flexible array member

- since C99 (ยง6.7.2.1, item 16, page 103)
- it is an array without a dimension specified that is the last member of
  the structure
  - this is handy for structures with a fixed header and "padding" data
    of flexible length that is allocated dynamically
    - why not to use a pointer instead ? this is good when passing data over boundaries
      such as network, kernel/userland, etc. since no deep structure copy is required

- e.g.:
```C
  struct item {
      int value;
      // possible other members
      char payload[];
      // nothing can follow
  };
```
- `sizeof (struct item)` will give the size without the last member computed

```
	+-------------+-----------------------+
	| struct item |      payload ...      |
	+-------------+-----------------------+
```

- previously, this was hacked around using array with 0 members and GCC accepted
  this. Since C99 this can be done properly using this technique.
- the data is allocated like so:
```C
    struct item *p = malloc(sizeof (struct item) +
        payload_len * sizeof (p->payload[0]));
```
- with this approach the overall structure alignment might be lost
  - i.e. it is necessary to set the payload length according to the size of the structure
  if you want to maintain alignment

:eyes: code: [flexbile-array-member.c](src/flexbile-array-member.c)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Unions

  - similar to structures however have different semantics
    - stores its members in the same memory location
    - allows for different "views" of the same data
  - usually combined with structures
  - handy for efficient data storage or HW programming

consider this declaration:
```C
  union foo {
    unsigned short i; // 2 bytes
    struct {
      unsigned char low;
      unsigned char high;
    } bytes;
  };
```
  - the `sizeof(union foo)` will be that of its largest member
  - modify a value of `i` and it will be reflected in the low/high values
    because `i` and bytes share the same location
```
		0             high memory addresses
		+-------------+
		|      i      |
		+-------------+
		| low  | high |
                +-------------+
```
  - union does not have to have a name - this is handy inside of a structure, 
  where the members of the union become directly accessible, 
  see :eyes: [union-unnamed.c](src/union-unnamed.c)

:wrench: Task: use the above declaration to find out if the program is running
      on big or little endian system (least significant byte is stored
      on lowest address). The program will print either "big endian" or
      "little endian" to standard output.

:eyes: code: [union-lowhigh.c](src/union-lowhigh.c)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: Home Task: implement a command line parser ala getopt(3). The global variable
	   'myoptarg' will be set if an option has an argument.

Note: call the function `mygetopt()` not to intermingle with the standard
      library's `getopt()`.  Implement the "POSIXly correct solution", i.e. stop
      once non-option argument is encountered (i.e. one not starting with `-`)
      or after the `--` option is reached.

:wrench: bonus task: implement myoptind/myopterr/myoptopt

See the following code on how to use getopt(3):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: Home Task: implement
```C
      char *strsepc(char **stringp, int c);

   which behaves like strsep(3) except that it searches only for the first
   occurence of single character.
