* quiz: is this possible to do with ternary operator ?
  - how would you fix it ?
  - the usual solution is to put this into macro. many libraries/programs
    define their own MAX/MIN macros.

# warmup: Mountain scenery generator.

A very simple moutain generator.  At every iteration you go either straight (`-`),
up (`/`), or down (`\`).  The program generates something like the following:

```
$ a.out
               /                         /--
            / / \- /--                  /   \                       / /-
           / \    \   \              /--     \-                   /- \  \
          /            \            /          \             /-- /       \
      / /-              \-  /--   /-            \-          /   \         \
     / \                  \-   \ /                \-  /-- /-
    /                           \                   \-   \
 /--
-
```

You will need a two-dimensional array to fill, then print.  Use `memset()` to
erase the array with spaces.  Check the man page for `memset()`.  For random
numbers, use `rand()` and `%` for modulo.  To initialize the random generator, use
`sranddev()` if you have it, or `srand(time(NULL))`.  Check the manual pages if
unsure (each function is supposed to have its manual page).

You can make it more complicated and make the ascii art smoother.  For example,
you can define that after `/` you cannot go down with `\` but you could do `/\`,
etc.  You would need to keep a state of the previous character.  You could
enerate something like this (use your imagination):
```
            .
           / \
          /   \__
      /\_/       \__/|
     /               |
    /                |__/............................
  _/
```

The algorithm goes from left to the right, one character at a time. At each
point it will decide whether the mountain will grow, descend or remain the same (hence the random numbers).

Once you got a working program, restructure the code into small functions (one for
printing a character based on random number, one for printing the whole 2-D
array, etc.).  so that global variables are avoided (use variable length array
function definition). The top-level function (`mountain()`) can be also called
with the array (and its dimensions) as input and you can try calling it multiple
times to see if a mountain range can be generated.

  code: mountain-generator.c


# Arithmetic type conversions

In (very) general, if *binary* operators have operands of different types, the
"lower" is promoted to "upper".  Eg. if one operand is a long double, the other
operand is promoted to a long double.

Chars and shorts are converted to ints or unsigned ints if they do not fit in an
int ("integral promotion").  This is done to make the runtime fast (on x86
32-bit arithmetics can be much faster than when using 16-bit operands).

sizeof (1) is 4 because 1 is an int.  However, if a number does not fit to an
int, a higher type will be used.  For example, 4294967296 (2^32) will be stored
in 8 bytes, and "sizeof (4294967296)" is 8.

Examples (assuming `char c;` declaration);
- sizeof (999) is 4 as "999" is an integer by definition.
- sizeof (c) is 1
- sizeof (c + c) is 4 as "+" is a binary operator and the integral promotion
  kicks in
- sizeof (++c) is still 1 as "++" is an unary operator and the integral
  promotion rules do not apply.
- sizeof (1LL) will usually be 8 as "long long" is usually 8 bytes.

It gets more interesting if unsigned and signed are involved.  Eg. a signed int
is promoted to an unsigned int if one of the operators is unsigned.

The above is called "implicit type conversion". There is also "explicit type
conversion" (called "casting") which will be dealt with later.

I suggest you try these out with `printf("%zu", ...)`.  `%zu` (see "man 3 printf")
matches the return type of the `sizeof` operand.  The exact unsigned numeric type
of what `sizeof` returns may differ in different implementations so `%zu` will work
anywhere.


# Negative numbers

Negative numbers are usually stored in two's complement (however, that is
implementation defined by the standard).  See:

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement

In short, you take an absolute value, create one's complement and add 1.  There
are several advantages, one is that there is only 1 zero (not negative and
positive zero if we used the highest bit to track the sign).  That is why a
signed char, for example, can hold -128 to 127, and not just -127 to 127.

For a char:
```
 10000000	-128
 ........
 11111101	  -3
 11111110	  -2      ^
 11111111	  -1      |
 --------------------------
 00000000	   0      |
 00000001	   1      v
 00000010	   2
 ........
 01111111	 127
```

On Unix systems the shell reports the -1 return value as 255 in 'echo $?'.
Even though the main() returns integer (4 bytes), the shell takes just low
8 bits and interprets them as unsigned quantity.

  code: return-1.c

If long is 8 bytes, and an int 4, then "-1L < 1U" as you might expect.

However, "-1 > 1U" because -1 is promoted to unsigned.  Two's complement
representation of -1 is (see the paragraph above):
```
(1) take absolute value of 1	00000000.00000000.00000000.00000001
(2) one's complement		11111111.11111111.11111111.11111110
(3) add 1 to get 2's complement	11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111
```
Which is 2^32 - 1.

Just `printf("%u\n", -1)` to see it will print 4294967295 (use the unix/linux
"bc" command and type "2^32-1" to verify).

  code: signed-plus-unsigned.c, signed-to-unsigned.c

The assymetry of the negative/positive interval can lead to the program crashing
on architectures that detect it. This is consequence of hardware handling rather
than the language.

  code: crashme.c
    - run with `-INT_MIN` (see limits.h) and -1
    - works in 64-bit mode as well due to int being passed in 32-bit registers

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* what is the result if `0xff` `signed char` and `0xff` `unsigned char` are compared
  using the `==` operator ?
  - write the hexadecimal representation of the integers corresponding to the
    2 chars with `printf()`

code: int-promotion.c
      - note that if the b char was defined as `char b` the result might be 1
        because it is up to the compiler to choose whether char will be signed
	or unsigned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* another quiz. Will the program print the whole array ?
  - try to come up with reason of the expected behavior before running the
    program.

  code: whole-array.c

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- when passing char to a function parameter declared as int, in 32-bit mode
  (`-m32`) it will be pushed as 32-bit value on the stack. This is not integer
  promotion but x86 ABI (Application Binary Interface)

code: x86-ABI.c, x86-ABI-2.c

  - for those who understand assembly run this with `-S` to see the differences
    between 32-bit and 64-bit mode, and the difference between when func()
    is defined with `int a` or `char a`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- each compiler has its own set of warnings that usually give a clue that
  something strange and potentially harmful can happen.
  - there are differences between various compilers
  - will focus on GCC here
  - during the old days the tool producing these warnings was called 'lint'

  - the basic: `-Wall -Wextra`
    - `-Wall` catches things like missing return value from a function that should
      return one

      code: no-return.c

    - there are many places where a beginner can shoot himself into a foot
      by not knowing the language intricacies.
      - e.g. variable cannot be modified more than one between sequencing
        points. The `-Wsequence-point` that is included in `-Wall` warns about that

        code: sequence-point-violation.c

  - the `-Wshadow` can catch shadow variables overriding:

    code: shadow.c, shadow-block.c

  - all or specific warnings can be turned into errors: `-Werrror` or
    `-Werror=<insert_specific_error>` , respectively
    - unless the warnings contain false positives (and those can usually be
      suppressed) this will help to avoid troubles later

  - there are other means to check for correctness (static/dynamic analysis),
    more on those later

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* go through the programs written so far and run the compiler using the
  `-Wall -Wextra` options.
  - what kind of problems did you discover ? how to fix them ?
    - see e.g. whole-array.c example above (where only -Wextra gives some clue)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- what happens if int overflows ?
  - the behavior of overflow depends on whether the type is signed or unsigned
    - for signed types the behavior is undefined ! i.e. you cannot rely on
      overflow of positive quantity in signed int will be turned into
      negative number on overflow ! Some compilers will allow to specify the
      behavior of signed overflows using special options (`-fwrapv` for GCC), though.
    - for unsigned, the overflow will wrap around (modulo power of 2)

  code: int-overflow.c, unsigned-overflow.c

    - use `-fstrict-overflow -Wstrict-overflow` (will become active only
      for higher optimization levels, i.e. -O<X> where X > 1) to stay on the safe side


* write a function that will have this prototype:
```C
  bool check(long off, size_t size, size_t limit);
```
  - the bool type exists since C99, use the stdbool.h include
  - that will check if the arguments are valid for accessing part of file
    (no operations will be done, just the check) of size 'size' starting from
    offset 'off'. The length of the file is given by 'limit'.

```
    |           |         |              |
    0          off     off+size        limit
```

  - try to capture all corner cases of what could go wrong with the values
    and return 0 on failure, 1 on success.

  code: range-check.c

  - on Unix systems one would use `ssize_t` for the offset which is signed
    integral type of the same size as `size_t` (this is not part of C99 but
    POSIX)
