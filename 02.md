# recap of the first class

- make sure you DO SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAILING LIST (see the public-notes in the 01
  folder on how to do that).  If you miss some information posted to the mailing
  list because you are not subscribed, it is your problem :-)

- recap of the assignment from the first class (not in 01/public-notes, only
  verbally assigned on Feb 21):
```
  /*
   * Implement a moving star that zick zacks on the __SAME__ line between some
   * boundary (say 50 character wide).
   *
   * This was an assignment after the __first__ C language seminar class in Feb
   * 2018.  After that intro class, students knew how to:
   *
   *	- declare variables of type int and float
   *	- do basic arithmetics
   *	- do a "while" loop
   *	- use an "if" (but __NOT__ "else")
   *	- use printf()
   *	- use a character '\r' to return to the beginning of a line
   *	- to use "poll(NULL, 0, <ms>)" to sleep <ms> miliseconds
   *
   * One thing I forgot to tell them was that they needed "fflush(stdout)" after
   * the line was printed.  As STDOUT is buffered, the text will generally not
   * be printed until a new line is printed, which is never the case here.
   */
```
   My solution (I strongly recommend you code it first by yourself) is in
   moving-star.c

# Source code management

- keep all of your code somewhere.  Use a distributed source code management
  (SCM) system, ie. git or mercurial.
	- you could keep your repo in your home directory in the Linux lab as
	  those machines are accessible via SSH from anywhere.
	- never use centralized SCMs like Subversion or CVS, unless you really
	  have to, as those are things of the past century.

# Comments

- `/* one line comment */`

- multi line comment:
```
  /*
   * multi line comment.  Follow the C style.
   * multi line comment.  Follow the C style.
   */
```
- `// one line comment from C99+`

- preprocessor
	- defines
	- includes
	- conditional compilation
	- use parens for #define
	  - `#define	X	(1 + 1)`
  - run the compiler with the -E flag to see preprocessor output

- Task: reimplement fahr-to-cent.c using defines instead of white numbers

# Expressions

- any expression has a value

- logical expression has value 0 or 1, so it's type is "int"
```
	1 > 10	... 0
	10 > 1	... 1

	printf("%d\n", 1 < 10);
	--> 1
	/* Yes, "equal to" in C is "==" as "=" is used for an assignment */
	printf("%d\n", 100 == 101);
	--> 0
```
- neverending while loop is then:
```
	while (1) {
		...
	}
```

# break statement

- statement "break" will cause a jump out of a most inner while loop (well, any
  loop but we only introduced while so far).
```
	int finished = 0;
	while (1) {
		if (finished)
			break;
		/* not finished work done here */				
		call_a_function();
		k = xxx;
		...
		if (yyy) {
			...
			finished = 1;
		}
		/* more work done here */
		...
	}
```

# Operators

- equality is "==" since a single "=" is an assignment operator

	int i = 13;
	if (i == 13) {
		// will do something here
	}

- logical AND and OR
```
	if (i == 13 && j < 10) {
		...

	if (i == 1 || k > 100) {
		...			
```
  - you do not need extra ()'s as || and && have higher priority than == and <, >, <=, >=, and !=.  We will learn more about operator priority in later lectures.

	- non-equality is !=
```
	if (i != 13) {
		...
	}
```

# numbers and types

- 1, 7, 20000 are always integers of type "int" if they fit (the range
  is [-2^31, 2^31 - 1] on 32/64 bit CPUs)
- hexadecimal numbers start with "0x" or "0X".  Eg. "0xFF", "0Xaa", "0x13f", etc.
- octal numbers start with "0".  Eg. "010" is 8 in decimal.  Also
  remember the Unix file mask (umask), eg. "0644".

- 'A' is int.  See `man ascii`.  The ASCII standard defines characters
  with values 0-127.

- float, double
	- man 3 printf, see %f is of type double.  You can use:

	  printf("%f\n", float)

- as floats are automatically converted to doubles if used as
	  arguments in functions with variable number of arguments
	  (known as a "variadic function"), ie.  like printf()

- char (1 byte), short (usually 2 bytes), long (4 or 8 bytes), long long
  (usually 8 bytes).  It also depends on whether your binary is compiled
  in 32 or 64 bits.

- as 'X' is int but within 0-127, it's OK to do the following as it will
  fit even if char is signed:
```
	char c = 'A';	  	
```
- each integer type has a "signed" and "unsigned" variant.  By default,
  the numeric types are signed aside from char which depends on
  the implementation.  If you need an unsigned type, use "unsigned"
  reserved word.
```
  signed int;
  unsigned int;
  unsigned long;
  unsigned long long;
  ...
```
- for ints, you do not need to use the "int" string, ie. "signed i",
  "unsigned u" are valid but it is recommended to use "signed int i" and
  "unsigned int u" anyway.

- You can use "long int" and "long long int" or just "long" and "long
  long", respectively.  The latter is mostly used in C.

- "char" and "short int" is converted to "int" in variadic functions (we
  will talk more about integer conversions later in semester).  Eg.  the
  following is OK as the compiler will first convert "c" to "int", then
  put it on the stack (x32 passing argument convention) or in a register
  (x64 convention).
```
	/* OK */
	char c;
	printf("%d\n", c);

	/* OK */
	short sh;
	printf("%d\n", sh);
```
- modifiers for printf
	- "l" for long, eg. `long l; printf("%ld\n", l");`
	- "ll" for long long, eg. `long long ll; printf("%lld\n", ll");`

- "u" is unsigned, "x" is unsigned hexa, "X" is unsigned HEXA
```
	unsigned int u = 13;
	printf("%u\n", u); 

	unsigned long long llu = 13;
	printf("%llu\n", llu); 

	unsigned int u = 13;
	printf("%x\n", u); 
	--> d
	printf("%X\n", u); 
	--> D
```
- the following is a problem though if compiled in 32 bits as you put 4
  bytes on the stack but printf will take 8 bytes.  Older compilers may
  not warn you at all!
```
	/* DEFINITELY NOT OK.  Remember, 13 is of the "int" type. */
	printf("%lld\n", 13);

	$ cc -m32 wrong-modifier.c
	wrong-modifier.c:6:19: warning: format specifies type 'long
	long' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
		printf("%lld\n", 13);
			~~~~     ^~
			%d
	1 warning generated.
	$ ./a.out
	2026120757116941
```
 - when compiled in 64 bits, it is still as wrong as before but
	 it will work anyway as 13 is assigned to a 64 bit register.
```
	$ cc -m64 wrong-modifier.c
	wrong-modifier.c:6:19: warning: format specifies type 'long
	long' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
		printf("%lld\n", 13);
			~~~~     ^~
			%d
	1 warning generated.
```

- you can explicitly specify larger integers with suffices

	"13L" and "13l" is long
	"13LL" and "13ll" is long long ("Ll" and "lL" is illegal)
	"13u" and "13U" is unsigned int
	"13lu" and "13LU" is unsigned long
	"13llu" and "13LLU" is unsigned long long

	so, "0xFULL" and "0XFULL" is unsigned long long 15 :-)

	printf("%llu\n", 0xFULL);
	--> 15

	printf("%lld", 13LL);	/* OK */
	printf("%ld", 13LL);	/* in general NOT OK */

- '\ooo' and '\xhh' are character sized bit patterns, either specified
  as octal or hexa numbers.

- "sizeof" operator computes the size of its argument which is an expression or
  a type
	- its type is `size_t` which is an unsigned integer according to the
	  standard.  However, the implementation (= compiler) can choose whether
	  it's an unsigned int, an unsigned long int, or an unsigned long long
	  int.
	- in printf(), "z" modifier modifies "u" to `size_t`, so this is the
	  right way to do it:

		printf("%zu\n", sizeof (13));
		4
	- the expression is not executed (the compiler should warn you about
	  those though)

		int i = 1;
		printf("%zu\n", sizeof (i = i + 1));
		--> 4
		printf("%d\n", i);
		--> 1

- try sizeof on various values and types in printf(), compile with `-m 32` and
  `-m 64` and see the difference
```
	sizeof (1);
	sizeof (char);
	sizeof (long);
	sizeof (long long);
	sizeof ('A');
	sizeof (1LL);
	...
```
- we will get there later in semester but if you are bored, try to figure out
  why the following is gonna print `1 4 4`:
```
	char c;
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (c));
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (c + 1));
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (+c));
	1
	4
	4
```
- in general, use internet search to get information if unsure; stackoverflow
  has lots of good discussions on C corner cases etc.

- printf("%c\n", 'A'); will print an integer as a character
  --> A
  printf("%c\n", 0101);
  --> A
  printf("%c\n", 0x41);
  --> A
  printf("%c\n", 65);
  --> A

  	- if you use a larger number than fits within a byte as an argument for
	  the %c conversion, the higher bits are trimmed.

	  printf("%c\n", 65 + 256 + 256 + 256 * 100);
	  --> still prints A

- assignment is also an expression, meaning it has a value of the result, so
  the following is legal and all "a", "b", and "c" will be initialized with 13;
```
	int a, b, c;

	a = b = c = 13;
```

# getchar()

- getchar() function reads one character from the process standard input and
  returns it value as a integer.
  	- if end of file, it returns EOF (which is a define, usually set as -1.
	  That is why getchar() returns an int and not a char as it needs an
	  extra value for the EOF).
	- getchar() needs `#include <stdio.h>`

- Task: write code that will read characters from a terminal and prints them out.
  BTW, "Ctrl-D" means end of file if pressed in a terminal.  It should work like
  this:
```
$ cat /etc/passwd | ./a.out > passwd
$ diff passwd /etc/passwd
$ echo $?
0
```
- remember, we said above that an assignment is just an expression, so it has a
  value.  So, you can do this:
```
	if ((c = getchar()) == EOF)
		return (0);
```
  instead of:
```
	c = getchar();
	if (c == EOF)
		return (0);
```

However, do NOT abuse it as you may create a hard to read code.  Note
	the parentheses around the assignment.  The "=" operator has lower
	priority than the "==" operator.  If the parens are not used, the
	following would happen:

`if (c = getchar() == EOF)` would be evaluated as:

`if (c = (getchar() == EOF))`, meaning that "c" would be either 0 or 1
		based on whether we read a character or the terminal input is
		closed.

We will learn more about operator priority later in the semester.

Solution: getchar.c

# Home assignment.  

It's voluntary but writing code is the only way to learn a programming language.

If unsure about the behavior, compile my solution and run it.

- count occurence of each 0-9 numbers.  Only use what we have learned so far.
  You end up with longer code than otherwise necessary but that is OK.

```
	$ cat /etc/passwd | ./a.out
	0: 27
	1: 37
	2: 152
	3: 38
	4: 39
	5: 43
	6: 34
	7: 35
	8: 29
	9: 31
```
	Solution: count-numbers.c

- convert small characters to upper chars in input.  Use the fact that a-z and
  A-Z are in two consequtive sections of the ASCII table.

	- use the else branch:
```
	if (a) {
		...
	} else {
		...
	{

	$ cat /etc/passwd  | ./a.out
