# Recap of the last class

# Warm-up

TBD: strlen() moved from 03 to here
# String length

We know that we can use `sizeof` to get a length of a character array including
the terminating `'\0'` character.  There is a more general way to get a string
length, function `strlen`().  Note that when we know what pointers are, the
existence of the fuction will make more sense.

The function is declared in `<string.h>` and returns a value of type `size_t`,
that is the same type as the operator `sizeof` uses.  So, remember to use the
`z` modifier to the `%u` conversion specifier:

```C
#include <string.h>

char s[] = "hello, world";

printf("Length of \"%s\": %zu\n", s, strlen(s));
```

Note that to include a literal `"` in a string, you just escape it.


Also I did not do multidimensional arrays from
http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang/2019/03--Mar-05/03.txt in 03 but I do suggest
to put them to a later class and not to 04.
