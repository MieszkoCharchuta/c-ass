# recap of the first class

- make sure you **do subscribe to the mailing list** (see http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang
  on how to do that).  If you miss some information posted to the mailing
  list because you are not subscribed, it is your problem :-)

- in general, use internet search to get information if unsure
  - https://stackoverflow.com has lots of good discussions on C corner cases etc.

- assignment from the previous class: moving star on the console
	- our solution (we strongly recommend you code it first by yourself) is
	  in [moving-star.c](/src/moving-star.c)

# warmup

Print conversion table for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell (rope length
used by Frodo and Sam in The Lord of the Rings had some 30 ells) to inches
and centimeters, i.e. table with 3 columns separated by tabs.

Print the centimeter value as float with 2 digit precision.

Each 10 lines print a line (sequence of `-` characters, say 20 times).
The line will immediately follow the table header and then will appear
each 10 lines. Use `while` cycle to print the line.

Print 30 of numeric rows.

Sample output:

```

# Source code management

- keep all of your code somewhere.  Use a distributed source code management
  (SCM) system, ie. Git or Mercurial.
  - you could keep your repo in your home directory in the Linux lab as
    those machines are accessible via SSH from anywhere.
  - never use centralized SCMs like Subversion or CVS, unless you really
    have to, as those are things of the past century.

# Comments

- `/* one line comment */`

- multi line comment:
```
  /*
   * multi line comment.  Follow the C style.
   * multi line comment.  Follow the C style.
   */
```
- `// one line comment from C99+`

# Preprocessor
  - defines
  - includes
  - conditional compilation
  - use parens for `#define` to prevent problems with macro expansion
  	- `#define	X	(1 + 1)`
  - run the compiler with the -E flag to see preprocessor output

To see the result of running preprocessor on your code, use `cpp` or
the `-E` option of the compiler.

- Task: reimplement fahr-to-cent.c using defines instead of literal numbers
	- solution: `fahr-to-cent_defines.c`

# Expressions

- any expression has a value

- logical expression has value 0 or 1, and it's type is always `int`
```
	1 > 10	... 0
	10 > 1	... 1

	printf("%d\n", 1 < 10);
	--> 1
	/* Yes, "equal to" in C is "==" as "=" is used for an assignment */
	printf("%d\n", 100 == 101);
	--> 0
```
- neverending while loop is then:
```
	while (1) {
		...
	}
```



# break statement

- statement `break` will cause a jump out of a most inner while loop (well, any
  loop but we only introduced while so far).
```
	int finished = 0;
	while (1) {
		if (finished)
			break;
		/* not finished work done here */
		call_a_function();
		k = xxx;
		...
		if (yyy) {
			...
			finished = 1;
		}
		/* more work done here */
		...
	}
```


# Operators

- equality is `==` since a single `=` is an assignment operator
```
	int i = 13;
	if (i == 13) {
		// will do something here
	}
```
- logical AND and OR
```
	if (i == 13 && j < 10) {
		...

	if (i == 1 || k > 100) {
		...
```
  - you do not need extra ()'s as `||` and `&&` have lower priority
    than `==` and `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, and `!=`.  We will learn more
    about operator priority in later lectures.

- non-equality is !=
```
	if (i != 13) {
		...
	}
```



# boolean

There is `bool` type as of C99. To use it, include `<stdbool.h>`.

See [bool.c](/src/bool.c).


# numbers and types

- 1, 7, 20000 are always integers of type `int` if they fit (the range is
  [-2^31, 2^31 - 1] on 32/64 bit CPUs)
- hexadecimal numbers start with `0x` or `0X`.  Eg. `0xFF`, `0Xaa`, `0x13f`, etc.
` octal numbers start with `0`.  Eg. `010` is 8 in decimal.  Also remember the
  Unix file mask (umask), eg. `0644`.

- `'A'` is `int`.  See `man ascii`.  The ASCII standard defines characters with
  values 0-127.

- float, double
  - man 3 printf, see `%f` is of type `double`.  You can use:

```C
	  printf("%f\n", float)
```

- as floats are automatically converted to doubles if used as arguments in
  functions with variable number of arguments (known as a "variadic function"),
  i.e. like printf()

- `char` (1 byte), `short` (usually 2 bytes), `long` (4 or 8 bytes), `long long`
  (usually 8 bytes).  It also depends on whether your binary is compiled in 32
  or 64 bits.

- as `'X'` is `int` but within 0-127, it's OK to do the following as it will fit
  even if `char` is signed:
```C
	char c = 'A';
```

## signedness

- each integer type has a `signed` and `unsigned` variant.  By default, the
  numeric types are signed aside from char which depends on the implementation.
  If you need an unsigned type, use `unsigned` reserved word.
```C
  signed int;
  unsigned int;
  unsigned long;
  unsigned long long;
  ...
```
- for ints, you do not need to use the `int` keyword, ie. `signed i`,
  `unsigned u` are valid but it is recommended to use `signed int i` and
  `unsigned int u` anyway.

- You can use `long int` and `long long int` or just `long` and `long long`,
  respectively.  The latter is mostly used in C.

- `char` and `short int` is converted to `int` in variadic functions (we will
  talk more about integer conversions later in semester).  Eg.  the following is
  OK as the compiler will first convert variable `c` to `int` type, then put it
  on the stack (Intel x32 passing argument convention) or in a register
  (Intel x64 convention).
```C
	/* OK */
	char c;
	printf("%d\n", c);

	/* OK */
	short sh;
	printf("%d\n", sh);
```
## modifiers for printf

- `l` for long, eg. `long l; printf("%ld\n", l);`
- `ll` for long long, eg. `long long ll; printf("%lld\n", ll);`

- `u` is unsigned, `x` is unsigned hexa, `X` is unsigned HEXA
```C
	unsigned int u = 13;
	printf("%u\n", u);

	unsigned long long llu = 13;
	printf("%llu\n", llu);

	unsigned int u = 13;
	printf("%x\n", u);
	// --> d
	printf("%X\n", u);
	// --> D
```
- the following is a problem though if compiled in 32 bits as you put 4 bytes on
  the stack but printf will take 8 bytes.  Older compilers may not warn you at
  all!
```
	/* DEFINITELY NOT OK.  Remember, 13 is of the "int" type. */
	printf("%lld\n", 13);

	$ cc -m32 wrong-modifier.c
	wrong-modifier.c:6:19: warning: format specifies type 'long
	long' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
		printf("%lld\n", 13);
			~~~~     ^~
			%d
	1 warning generated.
	$ ./a.out
	2026120757116941
```
 - when compiled in 64 bits, it is still as wrong as before but it will work
   anyway as 13 is assigned to a 64 bit register (because of x64 ABI).
```
	$ cc -m64 wrong-modifier.c
	wrong-modifier.c:6:19: warning: format specifies type 'long
	long' but the argument has type 'int' [-Wformat]
		printf("%lld\n", 13);
			~~~~     ^~
			%d
	1 warning generated.
```

## suffixes

- you can explicitly specify larger integers with suffices

	- `13L` and `13l` is long
	- `13LL` and `13ll` is long long (`Ll` and `lL` is illegal)
	- `13u` and `13U` is unsigned int
	- `13lu` and `13LU` is unsigned long
	- `13llu` and `13LLU` is unsigned long long

- so, `0xFULL` and `0XFULL` is unsigned long long 15 :-)
```C
	printf("%llu\n", 0xFULL);
	// --> 15
	printf("%lld", 13LL);	/* OK */
	/* in general NOT OK as long may be 4 bytes while long long 8 bytes */
	printf("%ld", 13LL);
```

- `\ooo` and `\xhh` are character sized bit patterns, either specified
  as octal or hexadecimal numbers.

## sizeof operator

- the `sizeof` operator computes the size of its argument which is an expression
  or a type
  - its type is `size_t` which is an unsigned integer according to the
    standard.  However, the implementation (= compiler) can choose whether
    it's an `unsigned int`, an `unsigned long int`, or an `unsigned long long
    int`.
  - in printf(), the `z` modifier modifies `u` to `size_t`, so this is the
    right way to do it:
```C
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (13));
	// --> 4
```

- the expression within the `sizeof` operator is **never** executed (the
  compiler should warn you about such code).

```C
	int i = 1;
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (i = i + 1));
	// --> 4
	printf("%d\n", i);
	// --> 1
```

- try sizeof on various values and types in printf(), compile with `-m 32` and
  `-m 64` and see the difference
```C
	sizeof (1);
	sizeof (char);
	sizeof (long);
	sizeof (long long);
	sizeof ('A');
	sizeof (1LL);
	// ...
```
- we will get there later in semester but if you are bored, try to figure out
  why the following is gonna print `1 4 4`:
```C
	char c;
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (c));
	// --> 1
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (c + 1));
	// --> 4
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (+c));
	// --> 4
```


## conversion

- all of these are equal:
```C
	printf("%c\n", 'A'); // will print an integer as a character
	// --> A
	printf("%c\n", 0101);
	// --> A
	printf("%c\n", 0x41);
	// --> A
	printf("%c\n", 65);
	// --> A
```
- if you use a larger number than fits within a byte as an argument for the `%c`
  conversion, the higher bits are trimmed.  The rule here is that the `int`
  argument is converted to `unsigned char`, then printed as a character.  More
  on integer conversion in upcoming lectures.

```C
	printf("%c\n", 65 + 256 + 256 + 256 * 100);
	// --> still prints A
```
- assignment is also an expression, meaning it has a value of the result, so the
  following is legal and all variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be initialized
  with 13
```C
	int a, b, c;
	a = b = c = 13;
```

# getchar()

- getchar() function reads one character from the process standard input and
  returns its value as a integer.
	- when it reaches end of input (for example, by pressing `Ctrl-D` in the
	  terminal), it returns `EOF` (which is a define, usually set as -1.
	  That is why getchar() returns an `int` and not a `char` as it needs an
	  extra value for the `EOF`).
	- getchar() needs `#include <stdio.h>`

- Task: write code that will read characters from a terminal and prints them out.
  It should work like this:
```
	$ cat /etc/passwd | ./a.out > passwd
	$ diff passwd /etc/passwd
	$ echo $?
	0
```
- remember, we said above that an assignment is just an expression, so it has a
  value.  So, you can do this:
```C
	if ((c = getchar()) == EOF)
		return (0);
```
  instead of:
```C
	c = getchar();
	if (c == EOF)
		return (0);
```

However, do NOT abuse it as you may create a hard to read code.  Note the
parentheses around the assignment.  The "=" operator has lower priority than the
"==" operator.  If the parens are not used, the following would happen:

`if (c = getchar() == EOF)` would be evaluated as:

`if (c = (getchar() == EOF))`, meaning that "c" would be either 0 or 1
		based on whether we read a character or the terminal input is
		closed.

We will learn more about operator priority later in the semester.

# Home assignment: digit occurrence

It's voluntary but writing code is the only way to learn a programming language.

If unsure about the behavior, compile our solution and run it.

- count occurence of each 0-9 digit.  Only use what we have learned so far.
  You end up with longer code than otherwise necessary but that is OK.

```
	$ cat /etc/passwd | ./a.out
	0: 27
	1: 37
	2: 152
	3: 38
	4: 39
	5: 43
	6: 34
	7: 35
	8: 29
	9: 31
```

Solution: [count-numbers.c](/src/count-numbers.c)

- convert small characters to upper chars in input.  Use the fact that a-z and
  A-Z are in two consequtive sections of the ASCII table.

	- use the else branch:
```
	if (a) {
		...
	} else {
		...
	{

	$ cat /etc/passwd  | ./a.out
